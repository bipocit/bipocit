# Frequently Asked Questions

## What does BIPOC mean?
You might be familiar with the term PoC (People of Color), which refers to non-white people. BIPOC is an extension of that and stands for Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color. This particular acronym was created to acknowledge Black and Indigenous people who have historically been the most marginalized.

## Is this initiative for me?
BIPOCIT is for anyone who is Black, Indigenous, and/or a Person of Color. We rely on your own self-reflection, by asking yourself if you have the privilege to enter most white-dominated spaces without feeling denied, ignored or excluded.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form, including, but not limited to, discrimination against QTIBIPoC/LGBTQIA+ people, discrimination against people with impairments and/or disabilities, sexism, racism, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim or anti-Blackness, or colorism.
