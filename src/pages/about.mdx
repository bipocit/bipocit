## Our Mission

BIPOCIT is a collective dedicated to creating community spaces where Black, Indigenous, && People of Color in Tech can be authentically themselves — their whole selves. 

We cultivate spaces where your power and capabilities are recognized, your identities are embraced, and where we grow not only as individuals but also as a collective. 

Our aim is to uplift and to bring strong communities closer together through celebration, communication, and collaboration. We intend to achieve this goal through (but not limited to) social and digital amplification, educational and social workshops, and event curation.

## History & Background

The BIPOCIT organization started as a private space within JS & CSS Conf EU — two of Europe’s largest front-end technology conferences. The conference organizers recognized the importance of providing BIPOC, a group that is historically underrepresented in tech, with a safer space. The result was the BIPOCIT Space: a place where they could retreat, share knowledge, network, and relax as their true selves. 

Throughout the course of the two conferences, the space received over 125 BIPOC participants, and the feedback following the conferences was overwhelmingly positive. After witnessing the need for such a space, we committed to continuing the work as an independent organization.
