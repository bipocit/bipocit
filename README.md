The official guide for getting started with the BIPOCIT website.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI if you haven't already** 

    `npm install -g gatsby-cli`


2.  **Then, install the rest of our dependencies**

    `npm i`

3.  **Now you can start developing**

    Navigate into the project root directory and run the following command to get started

    `
    gatsby develop
    `

4.  **Start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

5. **Replicating Production locally**

    If you want to verify what your production build will look like, first run:

    `
    gatsby build
    `

    Then run

    `
    gatsby serve
    `
    The production view can now be previewed at `http://localhost:9000/`
